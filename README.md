# eol_factions

Factions for FiveM like Minecraft. Create factions and invite members to them and claim as much land as possible!

## Setup

1. Download the resource from the green `Code` button.
2. Unpack the downloaded file and make sure the `-main` is removed from the folder name
3. Execute the sql file in your database
4. Start your server and enjoy

## Usage In-Game

To use it, execute the command `/faction` to open the faction management menu, from there you can manage the faction you're in or create a faction.

## Dependencies

Currently only standalone applications are supported, you can make your own framework application by editing the framework.lua to fit your framework. I don't want frameworks on the repo anymore due to all the maintenance it requires.
