# eol_factions

Factions for FiveM like Minecraft. Create factions and invite members to them and claim as much land as possible!

## Usage

To use it, execute the command `/faction` to open the faction management menu, from there you can manage the faction you're in or create a faction.

## Dependencies

qb-core is currently the only supported framework but soon I'll be adding standalone support so you don't need a framework to run this.
